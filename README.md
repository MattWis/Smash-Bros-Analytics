Streakability

How streaky is Super Smash Bros Brawl?

This project aims to answer that question using hard numbers.

To do this, we use Clash Tournament's SSBB singles videos (use keepvid or something?)

With these videos, we use image recognition to create a simple (JSON?) output that is basically the percentages and number of lives of each character over time. (C++, almost certainly)

We finally want to use higher level languages to actually process this data in statistically sound ways to answer that question.
