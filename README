Streakability

How streaky is Super Smash Bros Brawl?

This project aims to answer that question using hard numbers.

To do this, we use Clash Tournament's SSBB singles videos, downloaded by youtube-dl.

With these videos, we use image recognition to create a simple text output that is basically the percentages and number of lives of each character over time. (C++, using Tesseract OCR)

We finally want to use higher level languages to actually process this data in statistically sound ways to answer that question.


Usage:

First, add the scripts directory to your path
PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/scripts

The cd to videos/ and download your favorite tournament playlist
get_youtube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlIHVxA7UoL000OS8cpl9LLR8ULb3jcHZ

Then run the OCR program
ls *.mp4 | thread.sh generate_nums_360p

The OCR output is pretty noisy. There will soon be another script to output the data in a nicer format.
